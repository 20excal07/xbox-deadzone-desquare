# Prerequisites:
  - [**vJoy**](https://github.com/BrunnerInnovation/vJoy/releases/tag/v2.2.2.0)
  - [**FreePIE**](https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE/releases/tag/1.11.724)
  - An Xbox controller with s***ty aftermarket analog sticks
    - (the ones with square deadzones)
  - [**x360ce**](https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce/releases/tag/4.17.0.0)
    - this one's mostly for use with modern games, you need this to emulate the vJoy controller back into an Xbox controller.
    - you can also use Steam Input instead, that's also fine.

# Why tho?
I created this mainly out of spite for the stupid service person who swapped out my controller's dead analog stick for a new cheapo one, but didn't even bother seating the stick correctly on the board. This caused the new stick to misalign and unable to center properly, which screws up the deadzones, which in turn also screws up any calibration attempts on Windows. Turning the deadzones into a circle one allowed me to properly calibrate the controller on Windows and get the stick properly centered.

But that's just me though, the script will work on any controller that's had its sticks replaced with a questionable one. Xbox controllers by default have a circular deadzone, so, this script gives you back exactly that.
